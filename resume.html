	<h2>Resume</h2>

	<h3>Summary</h3>
				
	<p>I have taken many writing-intensive courses throughout my college career, and now use those skills to write for my own website. I have a breadth of kitchen experience, both from working at a bakery and from attending culnary classes at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts. These skills combined have opened the doors to writing my own e-Cookbook, and now I plan on attending graduate school in London this fall to pursue a master's degree in Publishing. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, listening to comedy podcasts, and traveling as much as humanly possible.</p>
